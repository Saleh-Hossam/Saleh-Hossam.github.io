### Who I Am
I am a **Data Analyst** based in Cairo, Egypt. My mission is to bridge the gap between **Business Logic** (Commerce/Accounting) and **Technical Solutions** (SQL/Power BI).

### My Core Philosophy
I believe in "Technical Mastery + Human Wisdom." Data is meaningless without the context to interpret it. I don't just run queries; I answer business questions.

### The Toolkit
* **SQL Server:** Complex Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Data Cleaning.
* **Power BI:** DAX, Data Modeling, Star Schema.
* **Excel:** Power Query, Pivot Tables.
